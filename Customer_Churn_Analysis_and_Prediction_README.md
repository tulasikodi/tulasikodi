# Customer_Churn_Analysis_and_Prediction

## 1. Project Overview
Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, especially in subscription-based industries. This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns and predict churn using machine learning techniques. By identifying the key drivers of churn, businesses can proactively improve customer retention strategies.

##  2. Project Description

This project involves the analysis of customer data to understand churn behavior and develop actionable insights. The dataset includes information on customer demographics, service details, payment methods, and churn status.

### Our goal is to:

#### Analyze customer churn to uncover key trends.

#### Build a dashboard to visualize churn insights effectively.

#### Predict which customers are likely to churn and suggest strategies to mitigate it.

## 4. Problem Statement
Businesses often face the challenge of high churn rates, leading to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs.

### Key Questions Addressed:
#### What patterns exist among customers who churn?
#### How can we predict customers likely to churn?
#### What strategies can reduce churn and improve retention?

## 5. Executive Summary

The analysis revealed the following key insights:

#### Churn Rate: 27% of customers churned out of 6,418 total customers.
#### Demographics:

64.15% of churned customers were male.

Churn rates were highest among customers aged 25â€“35.

#### Services Used:

Customers using Fiber Optic Internet had the highest churn rate (41%).

Customers not using online security services were more likely to churn.

#### Geographical Trends:

States such as Jammu and Assam exhibited higher churn rates (57% and 38%, respectively).
A predictive model was developed to identify at-risk customers, achieving an accuracy of 90%.

## 6. Insights
### What We Did:
#### Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

Standardized column names for consistency.
